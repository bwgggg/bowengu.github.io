I received my Ph.D. degree from Macau University of Science and Technology in 2024, where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Dong Li](https://sites.google.com/view/eedongli). I obtained a joint M.S. degree from Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2021, during which I worked with [Prof. Yoongjun Xu](https://faculty.cqupt.edu.cn/xuyj/zh_CN/index.htm), and earned my B.S. degree from Shaanxi University of Science and Technology in 2018.
