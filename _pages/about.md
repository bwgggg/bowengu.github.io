I received my Ph.D. degree from Macau University of Science and Technology in 2024, where I was fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Dong Li. I obtained a joint M.S. degree from Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2021, during which I worked with Prof. Yoongjun Xu, and earned my B.S. degree from Shaanxi University of Science and Technology in 2018.
